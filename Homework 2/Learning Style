The outcome of the Learning Style quiz was as I had expected it would be. I have inattentive ADHD and have trouble focusing and absorbing information unless I am doing something physically or watching something engaging. This is why online classes are good for me. I have trouble listening to what is being said so it helps to be able to go back and re-listen or read things over again.
