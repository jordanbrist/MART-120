        <h1>Ghost Fragment: Thorn</h1>
        <h2>The Rose</h2>

        <p>The noble man stood. And the people looked to him. For he was a beacon - hope given form, yet still only a man. And within that truth there was great promise. If one man could stand against the night, then so too could anyone - everyone.</p>

            In his strong hand the man held a Rose. And his aura burned bright.
            
        <p>When the man journeyed on, the people remembered. In his wake hope spread. But the man had a secret fear. His thoughts were dark. A sadness crept from the depths of his being. He had been a hero for so long, but pride had led him down sorrow's road.</p>
            
            Slowly the shadows' whisper became a voice, a dark call, offering glories enough to make even the brightest Light wander. He knew he was fading, yet he still yearned.
            
        <p>On his last day he sat and watched the sun fall. His final thoughts, pure of mind, if not body, held to a fleeting hope - though they would suffer for the man he would become, the people would remember him as he had been.</p>
            
            And so the noble man hid himself beneath a darkness no flesh should touch, and gave up his mortal self to claim a new birthright. Whether this was choice, or destiny, is a truth known only to fate.
            
        <p>In that cool evening air, as dusk was devoured by night, the noble man ceased to exist. In his place another stood.</p>
            
            Same meat. Same bone. But so very different.
            
        <p>The first and only of his family. The sole forbearer and last descendent of the name Yor.</p>
            
            In his first moments as a new being, he looked down at his Rose and realized for the first time that it held no petals: only the jagged purpose of angry thorns.</p>
